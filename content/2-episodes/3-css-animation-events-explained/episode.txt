Summary:

A step-by-step tutorial on listening for CSS animation events with JavaScript and the additional details you can get from them! The example we use is live on the lovely [codepen.io](cdpn.io/BnAwx) and the full list of links and resources are on my site. In an odd turn of events, there are no cats in this tutorial.

Music from the super happy and upbeat Alpine. Go buy *A is for Alpine* on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/A-Is-Alpine/dp/B00C2U6E60) or [iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/a-is-for-alpine/id636157647).
